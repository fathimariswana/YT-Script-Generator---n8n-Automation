YouTube Script Generator

Use Case Description 
This workflow automates the creation, review, and logging of YouTube 
video scripts. When a user submits a video idea and target duration via a 
web form, the workflow uses AI to generate a detailed video script. The 
script is sent to a manager for approval via email. Upon approval, key 
script details are logged to Google Sheets. Robust error handling is in 
place for every critical step. This automation saves time for content teams, 
ensures quality through human review, and provides an auditable log for 
future reference.
